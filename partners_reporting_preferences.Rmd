### 1. Number of organisations and persons who reported

A total of **`r reporting %>% nrow()`** participants from **`r reporting %>% distinct(org_name) %>% nrow()`** organisations submitted information on the food security reporting preferences survey. 

```{r}
reporting %>% 
  group_by(org_name, implementing_partner_type) %>%  
  summarise(persons = n(), .groups = "drop") %>% 
  mutate(org_name = fct_reorder(org_name, persons)) %>% 
  arrange(org_name) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(persons, org_name, fill = implementing_partner_type)) +  
  geom_col() +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 13), 
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 13),
